# aiohttp Async API Calls

This repository contains examples and exercises related to using aiohttp in Python for making asynchronous calls to APIs. The main goal is to explore and learn about the aiohttp library while working with asynchronous calls to web services.

## Prerequisites

Before running the examples, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you'll need a valid API key for the API you wish to use. For the provided examples, we assume the use of an Alpha Vantage API key. Ensure you have your Alpha Vantage API key ready to use.

## Configuration

To run the examples, you'll need to set up your development environment properly. You are expected to define an environment variable named `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY` containing your Alpha Vantage API key. You can do this by placing the following line in your terminal or environment configuration file:

```bash
export ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, you can use pip to install the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Examples

Within this repository, you'll find a variety of examples demonstrating how to make asynchronous calls to different APIs using aiohttp. Each example is designed to show you different aspects and functionalities of aiohttp in the context of asynchronous calls to web services.

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute to this repository by adding your own examples, improving documentation, or fixing bugs. All contributions are welcome!

## Additional Notes

Remember to check the official aiohttp documentation for more information on how to use the library and make the most of its features: [aiohttp Documentation](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/)
